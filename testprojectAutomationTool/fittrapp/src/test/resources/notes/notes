TDD : Test Data Driven development : Test NG
BDD : Behavior driven development

1) We are defining the behavior of frame work, Test case, use case
2) Behavior means : Simple normal plain English by language Gherkin Keyword
3) Gherkin is feature language to define BDD framework.
4) BDD is similar to TDD, where we start of it with test, however, in BDD we start of it by writing behavior.

What is BDD?

5) When Customer comes and says show me the feature what it delivers, we can't show that. Cucumber helps in solving this problem
by creating behavior around test. Because the way behavior are written is going to help them to understand feature.

When you need to communicate the feature to somebody who is not technical.
